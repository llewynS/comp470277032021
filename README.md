# Practical Activities 
## Getting started
The following instructions assume that you have python, pip, and git installed and that they are added to PATH. If you are using anaconda don't use pip use the conda package installer.

In terminal, cmd, or powershell
1. Clone this repository using (If you do not have git install it):
    `git clone https://github.com/llewynS/COMP47027703DATA7703.git`
2. Change directory:
    `cd DATA7703`
3. Create a virtual python environment by calling in this directory 
    `python3 -m venv machine_learning`
If you do not have virtual env installed you can install it with:
    `pip install virtualenv --user`
4. On windows:
    `.\machine_learning\Scripts\activate`
   On Linux (from memory could be wrong, don't be scared to google!):
    `source machine_learning/bin/activate`
5. Install required libraries:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Open jupyter and open the prac you want:
    `jupyter notebook`
